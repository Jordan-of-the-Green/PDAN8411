It involves several steps, including vectorization, lemmatization, stemming, tokenization, and removing stop words. By following these steps, the text can be converted into a structured format that machine learning models can analyse.  \n"

This binary classification problem is well-suited for applying various text processing techniques to clean and prepare the text data, which can then be used to train and evaluate machine learning models. As is common with real-world text data, the dataset is reasonable in size and contains a mix of formal and informal language.  "
